screenshot.png is an image file that should visually represent your WordPress theme. Since I cannot create or provide actual image files, you will need to create a screenshot of your theme and save it as `screenshot.png` in the specified directory.

To create the screenshot, you can take a screenshot of your theme's homepage or any other relevant page and save it in the `wordpress-theme` directory. Make sure the dimensions are appropriate for WordPress, typically 1200x900 pixels.

If you need further assistance with any specific aspect of your theme or additional files, feel free to ask!
